 Patient Dataset Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the demographics and clinical data of patients diagnosed with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). The objective is to extract meaningful insights, identify patterns, and apply machine learning techniques to support better diagnosis and treatment strategies.

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes demographic and clinical information about OCD patients. Key attributes in the dataset:
- **Age**
- **Gender**
- **Diagnosis Details**
- **Severity Scores**
- **Treatment History**
- **Additional Clinical Attributes**

## Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and distributions.
- Preprocess and clean the dataset for better model performance.
- Apply statistical and machine learning techniques to predict OCD severity.
- Visualize insights using graphs and charts.

## Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, outlier detection, and standardizing data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Generating statistical summaries and visualizations.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Selecting and transforming relevant features.
4. **Model Building:** Applying classification and regression models to predict clinical outcomes.
5. **Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using relevant metrics.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Machine Learning Algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVM, etc.)
